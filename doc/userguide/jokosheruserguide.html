        <h2><a name="Welcome">Welcome</a></h2>
        <p>Welcome to the start of an exciting journey! </p>
	<p>Jokosher is a simple to use, yet devilishly powerful Open Source
	audio workstation. With it you can create and record music, audio and
	other projects.  Jokosher has been specifically designed around ease of
	use and helping you to ignore the software and concentrate on your
	projects. We have taken every step to make it as intuitive as possible,
	but naturally a user guide is always helpful in explaining the
	specifics. This is that user guide. </p>
	<p>Jokosher is an organic piece of software and grows and improves
	gradually.  Due to its Open Source foundation, different people from
	all over the world work on it to make it the best tool for creating
	audio and music easily.  Likewise, this guide reflects that organic
	nature and also grows naturally.  This guide presents you with a
	complete guide to the features and facilities available in Jokosher. As
	each new release pops its head over the horizon, this guide will
	explain the awesome new features you can use. </p> 
	<p>Like any Open Source project, Jokosher and this guide needs your
	help.  Invariably in most Open Source projects, the documentation
	always falls behind and does not track the progress of the application
	it is documenting. We really, really don't want this to happen with
	Jokosher. Our lovingly crafted Jokosher is made for musicians, and we
	want it to be simple and easy to use, and this guide plays an essential
	role. If something is incorrect, outdated or just plain broken, roll up
	your sleeves and fix it. It will be a great contribution to this
	important project. </p>
        <h2><a name="Getting_Started">Getting Started</a></h2>
        <p>Fire up Jokosher by selecting <b>Applications-&gt;Sound &amp; Video-&gt;Jokosher</b>.</p>
        <p>When Jokosher starts, you see the Welcome dialog shown in Figure 2-1: </p>
        <img alt="Jokosher Welcome Dialog"
src="images/welcomedialog.png">
        <p><b>Figure 2-1</b><BR><i>The Welcome dialog box</i> </p>
        <p>The welcome dialog has a number of different facilities: </p>
        <ul>
                <li><b>Recent Projects</b> - the list of recent projects
                provide a simple means of accessing your most recent projects,
                with the most recent ones at the top. To load a project just
                double-click it.</li>
                <li><b>Create a New Project</b> - click this button to create a
                new Jokosher project. See Creating a New Jokosher Project
                below.</li>
                <li><b>Browse for an Existing Project</b> - this button pops up
                a file dialog box to allow you to find an existing project file
                on your computer. See Opening Jokosher Projects below. </li>
                <li><b>Preferences</b> - clicking this button displays the main
                Jokosher preferences window.</li>
                <li><b>Quit</b> - click this to exit out of Jokosher.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You know, some people really hate welcome dialogs like this, so we
        plonked a nice fat <b>Don't show this on start-up</b> tickbox. Tick it
        to never be pestered by the welcome dialog again. There are a few cool
        things you can configure for Jokosher start-up, see <a
                href="#Configuring_Jokosher_Preferences">Configuring Jokosher
                Preferences</a> for the juicy bits. </p>
        <p>So, which option did you pick? Well, lets run through them... </p>
        <h3><a name="Creating_a_New_Jokosher_Project">Creating a New Jokosher Project</a></h3>
        <p>You can create project by either selecting the Create a New Project
        button from the welcome dialog or by clicking <b>File-&gt;New
                Project</b> in the main window. </p>
        <p>A dialog box then appears and you are asked for some details: </p>
        <ul>
                <li><b>Project Name</b> - enter a name for the project here.
                This is most likely going to be the song title or podcast
                title.</li>
                <li><b>Folder</b> - select a folder where your project is held.
                Please note that the folder you select will have a new
                directory created for it. So, as an example, if you select
                /home/bob/projects for this option and your Project Name is
                Booya, a directory called booya inside /home/bob/projects will
                be created.</li>
                <li><b>Author</b> - enter your name or the name of your band in
                this box. This is the author of the project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you have added these details, click the <b>OK</b> button to
        continue. </p>
        <p><i>If this is your first time using Jokosher, jump to
        <a href="#The_Main_Jokosher_Window">The Main Jokosher Window</a>.</i></p>
        <h3><a name="Opening_Jokosher_Projects">Opening Jokosher Projects</a></h3>
        <p>You can open existing projects by either selecting <b>Browse for an
                Existing Project</b> from the welcome dialog or clicking
        <b>File-&gt;Open</b> in the main window. </p>
<p>When you select this option, the GNOME file picker pops up. Jokosher
projects are stored in a directory with the same name as the project. Inside
that directory is a <code>.jokosher</code> file. Double click it to load it.
</p>
        <p><i>If this is your first time using Jokosher, jump to
        <a href="#The_Main_Jokosher_Window">The Main Jokosher Window</a>.</i>
        </p>
        <h2><a name="The_Main_Jokosher_Window">The Main Jokosher Window</a></h2>
        <p>The main Jokosher window is where the action happens (Figure 3-1): </p>
        <img alt="The Main Jokosher Window"
src="images/mainwindow.png">
        <p><b>Figure 3-1</b><br><i>The main Jokosher window</i></p>
        <p>Unlike other less fun and fabulous multi-trackers, Jokosher does not
        inflict lots of itty-bitty windows on you. Here everything happens
        inside a single window, making it simple to see what is going on at any
        one time. </p>
        <h3><a name="The_Menus">The Menus</a></h3>
        <p>Along the top side of the screen you can see a bunch of menus. You
        can find virtually everything in those menus, and if you are stuck
        figuring out how to do something, flick through the menus. </p>
        <H4>File</H4>
        <ul>
                <li><b>New</b> - opens a new project in the existing window. If
                there are changes in the current project, you will be offered a
                chance to save it. To add an instrument to the open project,
                see <a href="#Adding_Instruments">Adding Instruments</a>.</li>
                <li><b>Open</b> - opens an existing project. If there are
                changes in the current project, you will be offered a chance to
                save it. </li>
                <li><b>Save</b> - saves the current project. This option
                quickly saves all information in the project including Undo and
                Redo history. </li>
                <li><b>Save As</b> - same as Save above, but this option allows
                you to save the project under a different name. </li>
                <li><b>Close</b> - closes the current project without closing
                Jokosher. Again, you'll get a chance to save the project if
                there are changes. </li>
                <li><b>Recent Projects</b> - this submenu lists up to the last
                8 projects opened in Jokosher. This is a convenient way to move
                quickly from one project to another. </li>
                <li><b><a name="Mixdown_Project">Mixdown Project</a></b> -
                brings up a dialog that begins the final stage of your project
                - the mixdown. Choose a name for the output file, a location
                where you want it saved, and an output format. Jokosher will
                then mix the project and save it as a single audio file in your
                chosen format.</li>
                <li><b>Quit</b> - quits Jokosher completely. You will get a
                chance to save any unsaved work. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Edit</h4>
        <ul>
                <li><b>Undo</b> - Undoes the last change that you made to the
                project.</li>
                <li><b>Redo</b> - Redoes the last thing that was undone with
                <b>Undo</b>.</li>
                <li><b>Cut</b> - Removes the selected object from the project
                and place it on the clipboard, replacing what was there
                previously. </li>
                <li><b>Copy</b> - Puts a copy of the currently selected object
                on to the clipboard, replacing what was there previously. </li>
                <li><b>Paste</b> - Places the contents of the clipboard into
                the project. See <a href="#Editing_Functions">Editing
                        Functions</a> below for details on selecting pieces of
                audio to cut, copy and paste</li>
                <li><b>Delete</b> - Removes the selected object from the
                project and discards it.</li>
                <li><b>Preferences</b> - Opens the <a href="#Configuring_Jokosher_Preferences">Jokosher Preferences</a> window.</li>

                <li><b>Change Instrument Type</b> - Allows you to change the
                        type of an instrument. For example if you've added a Bass Drum and would later like to change it to a Drum Kit, you can do it with this function. Note that you can also change instrument type by clicking directly on the instrument icon within the Instrument lane.</li>
                <li><a name="Instrument_Connections"><b>Instrument
                                Connections</b></a> - This dialog lists each
                instrument in the project and shows which input from your sound
                card is connected to that instrument. For each instrument you
                can change the connection by clicking the drop-down box and
                choosing an input to connect. </li>
                <li><b>Time Format</b> - Selects how time is displayed on the

        </ul>
        <h3><a name="The_Toolbar">The Toolbar</a></h3>
        <p>Below the menus are the main toolbar buttons. These buttons are nice
        and big to help you when perched over your desk holding your guitar.
        They do a bunch of interesting things: </p>
        <ul>
                <li><b>Add Instrument</b> - click this button to add an
                instrument to the project. See <a
                        href="#Adding_Instruments">Adding Instruments</a>.</li>
                <li><b>Rewind, Play, Forward, Record</b> - these buttons
                control playback and recording. </li>
                <li><b>Time display</b> - this shows the current elapsed time
                in the project.  Time will be displayed in hours, minutes and
                seconds or bars, beats and ticks, depending on the time format
                you've chosen in the Project menu.</li> <li><b>Workspace
                        Selector</b> - these buttons allow you to switch
                between the two workspace views in Jokosher. </li>
                <li><b>Click Track</b> - this feature generates a click that
                you can play along with. You can set speed (in beats per minute)
                and time signature. To activate the click track, simply click the
metronome icon. You will then hear the beep during recording and playback.</li>
                <li><b>Time Line</b> - this ruler gives you a visual
                representation of your project in time. The line will be marked
                off in measures or in seconds, depending on you current time
                format. </li>
                <li><b>Project Zoom</b> - this area at the bottom of the main
                window will help you zoom in and out and scroll the project
                quickly. The minus icon zooms the timeline out and the plus icon zooms
                in. While the plus and minus icons zoom a step at a time, the slider between the two will zoom the timeline quickly by dragging the slider. You can also drag the scroll bar (to the left of the icons) to move the visible area of
                your project if it doesn't all fit on the screen. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="Configuring_Jokosher_Preferences">Configuring Jokosher Preferences</a></h3>
        <p>The Jokosher preferences menu can be found by clicking
        <b>Edit-&gt;Preferences</b>. Here you can change settings that
        determine how Jokosher works. Note that these settings will be saved
        for Jokosher globally, not on a per-project basis. </p>
        <ul>
                <li><b>Application Start-up</b> - Chooses how Jokosher
                        will act when it first starts. The three options are:
                        <ul>
                                <li><b>Show welcome dialog</b> - the default.
                                Choose this option if you'd like to pick a
                                project every time Jokosher starts.</li>
                                <li><b>Open most recent project</b> - Choose
                                this option if you'd like to skip the welcome
                                dialog and jump to the project you had open the
                                last time you used Jokosher.</li>
                                <li><b>Don't open anything</b> - Choose this
                                option if you want total control. You can open
                                a project later from the <b>File</b> menu.
                                </li>
                        </ul></li>
                <li><b>Recorded Audio Format</b> - Changes the format in which
                        Jokosher saves recorded instruments while working on a
                        project. </li>
                <li><b>Audio Playback Device</b> - Changes the audio hardware used for
                        playback.  Again this depends on the hardware installed
                        on your system. You may only have one option. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="The_Workspaces">The Workspaces</a></h2>
        <h3><a name="Recording_View">Recording View</a></h3>
        <p>Inside the recording view, only the instruments are displayed. This
        is where you will spend most of your time recording, editing and
        re-recording. </p>
        <p>Recording is the first step in the process of creating a project.
        You will add Instruments, usually one at a time, record audio into that
        Instrument, then add the next instrument. Working in the recording view
        usually follows the steps listed here: </p>
        <h4><a name="Recording">Recording</a></h4>
        <ol>
                <li><b>Add Instruments</b> - See <a
                        href="#Adding_Instruments">Adding Instruments</a> below
                for details on this process. After an Instrument is added, you
                will see that it has the following features (See Figure
                4-1):

                        <li><b>Instrument Icon</b> - the same icon you saw when
                        you chose the Instrument.</li>
                        <li><b>Instrument Label</b> - this can be changed at
                        will simpy by clicking on it. It is just a label to
                        identify the Instruments in case you have several with
                        the same icon.</li>
                        <li><b>Record Button</b> - this button will be clicked
                        to "arm" the Instrument during recording.</li>
                        <li><b>Mute Button</b> - this button will silence the
                        Instrument uring playback.</li>
                        <li><b>Solo Button</b> - the opposite of the mute
                        button. When ressed, you will hear this Instrument as
                        "solo" during playback, with all other Instruments
                        muted.</li>
                        <li><b>Effects Button</b> - allows you to configure
                        effects for this instrument. See <a href="#Instrument_Effects">Instrument
                        Effects</a> for details.</li>
                        <li><b>Recording Lane</b> - to the right of the buttons
                        is an area here recorded audio will be displayed for
                        this instrument. </li>
                </ul></li>
                <li><b>Set Connections</b> - as explained in <a
                        href="#Instrument_Connections">Instrument
                        Connections</a> above, the different sound card inputs
                can be routed to different Instruments at will. In this way,
                even if there is only one input, by connecting it to each
                Instrument in turn multiple Instruments can be recorded.</li>
                <li><b>Record</b> - at this point you are ready to record this
                Instrument. If it's a live instrument, plug it in, press the
                "arm" button, then hit the <b>Record</b> button on the main
                Toolbar. When done recording, click <b>Stop</b>. To record an
                existing audio file, right-click on the Instrument recording
                lane then click <b>Import Audio File</b>. Find the file you'd
                like to import, then click <b>Open</b>. Notice that the audio
                is now in the recording lane for that Instrument. The waveform
                shows you the volume level at any point in the recording.</li>
                <li><b>Repeat</b> - unarm this Instrument and begin the process
                again by adding the next Instrument until all Instruments are
                recorded.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4><a name="Editing">Editing</a></h4>
        <p>Once all Instruments are recorded, editing begins. Think of the
        Instruments as raw materials that you will shape into a final project.
        Jokosher offers several tools to help with editing. </p>
        <ul>
                <li><b>Move</b> - this function shifts a piece of audio in
                time. To <b>Move</b> a piece of audio, click it and drag it
                left or right until it is in the desired position. When
                recording Instruments separately, this function can be used to
                get Instruments in synch with each other.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
                <li><p>In order to edit audio, a recording often needs to be
                broken up into pieces.  Jokosher offers two main tools to do
                this: </p>
                <ul>
                        <li><b>Split</b> - this function divides the audio in
                        an Instrument into two sections. Use <b>Split</b> when
                        you want to keep the entire recording, but need to
                        break it into pieces. To split, double-click in the
                        Instrument lane at the point where the audio should be
                        divided.</li>
                        <li><b>Trim</b> - this function deletes everything but
                        a selected piece piece of audio. To <b>Trim</b>, hold
                        down the <b>Shift</b> key, click with the mouse at the
                        beginning of the section you'd like to <b>Trim</b>,
                        drag the mouse to the right to the end of the desired
                        section, and release both the <b>Shift</b> key and the
                        mouse button. A <b>Trim</b> tab will appear below the
                        selected section. Click this tab to <b>Trim</b>. </li>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
                <li><b>Volume fades</b> - volume levels can be edited for pieces of audio. Select a section of an 
        instrument by pressing <b>Shift</b>, then clicking and dragging. You see a selection as in figure 4-2 below.
        Notice the red fade points, which will initially be labelled "100%". Simply grab the fade point and drag
        up and down to adjust volume at that point. 
        <br><img alt="Selection features"
        src="images/selection.png"><br>
                <b>Figure 4-2</b><br><i>Selection features</i></p></li>
                <li><b>Cut and Paste</b> - this function moves pieces of audio
                from one place to another. If you don't want to <b>Cut</b> a
                complete recording, <b>Split</b> it into pieces or <b>Trim</b>
                as above to separate the piece you'd like to work with. Next
                click on the peice you'de like to <b>Cut</b>, click
                <b>Edit-&gt;Cut</b> (or press <b>Ctrl-X</b>). Click in the spot
                where this piece should go.  Click <b>Edit-&gt;Paste</b> (or
                press <b>Ctrl-V</b>).</li>
                <li><b>Copy and Paste</b> - this function is used to make
                copies of the same audio in more than one place. It is similar
                to <b>Cut and Paste</b> above. First select a piece of audio,
                then click <b>Edit-&gt;Copy</b> (or press <b>Ctrl-C</b>). Click
                in the spot where this piece should go. Click
                <b>Edit-&gt;Paste</b> (or press <b>Ctrl-V</b>).</li>
                <li><b>Delete</b> - this removes a piece of audio completely
                from a Project. Select the section you want to delete then
                click <b>Edit- &gt;Delete</b> or press the <b>Delete</b> key on
                the keyboard.</li>
                <li><b>Undo</b> - in case you accidentally deleted a piece of
                audio or pasted it into the wrong spot, you can easily revert
                that mistake. Simply select <b>Edit-&gt;Undo</b> (or press
                <b>Ctrl+U</b>) and the last change you performed will be reverted.
                You can undo more steps by repeating the process.</li>
                <li><b>Redo</b> - if you wish to bring back a change you reverted
                with the <b>Undo</b> function, you can use <b>Redo</b>. Just click
                <b>Edit-&gt;Redo</b> (or press <b>Ctrl+R</b>) and the last change
                you reverted with undo will be restored.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="Mixing_View">Mixing View</a></h3>
        <p>This is the main mixing view. This view displays smaller versions of
        your Instrument tracks as well as mixing sliders for adjusting
        instrument volume levels. This is where you mix your final project.
        </p>
        <p>Much of the functionality of the <b>Recording View</b> is still
        available. The emphasis, though, is on getting the balance right
        between the Instruments. </p>
        <p><b>Volume Slider</b> - each Instrument has a corresponding slider.
        These sliders control the overall volume in the mix of that Instrument.
        Volume is displayed on the slider as a range from 0 to 1.00. Notice
        that as the slider is moved, the volume level changes audibly and
        visually. </p>
        <p><b>Instrument Hide</b> - at the top of each slider is an icon that
        can be clicked to hide that Instrument. It's still there, just out of
        the way.  At the bottom of the screen just above the status bar is an
        <b>Instruments Not Shown:</b> list. Click on an Instrument in the list
        to bring it back.  Hiding Instruments is useful when you havve many
        Instruments and only want to work on a few at a time. For example if
        you have 3 vocalists, you could mute and hide all other Instruments,
        while you mix the vocals. </p>
        <p><b>Master volume</b> - at the far right of the screen is the
        <b>Master Volume</b> slider. This slider changes the overall volume of
        the project. </p>
        <h4><a name="Adding_Instruments">Adding Instruments</a></h4>
        <p>Instruments are a key concept in Jokosher. Think in Instruments
        instead of Tracks. Instrument allow you to tell a lot about your
        project at a glance.  Tracks are just tracks! </p>
        <p>Currently, instruments are very simple - they just contain the name
        and icon of the instrument. In the future we plan on storing audio
        settings for each type of instrument. As an example when you use a
        Snare drum, the EQ will be optimised for a Snare drum. </p>
        <img alt="The Add Instrument Dialog"
src="images/add_instrument.png">
        <p><b>Figure 4-3</b><br><i>Adding instruments is simple</i></p>
        <p>To add and instrument, click on the Add Instrument button to bring
        up the dialog. Simply pick the instrument that is closest to what
        you'll be recording.  Click <b>OK</b> and you're done. </p>
        <p>Notice that once an instrument is added, you can click on its name
        and change it to anything you want. </p>
        <h2><a name="Extensions">Jokosher Extensions</a></h2>
        <p>Jokosher now has a new feature called Extensions. This allows for
        third party developers to add features to Jokosher, make it support new
        file types or even do something amazing that none of us has anticipated.</p>
        <p>You can configure Extensions in the <b>Extensions</b> menu which contains
        at least the <b>Manage Extensions</b> item which brings up the Extensions Manager
        (Figure 5-1). Depending on what extensions you have installed, other entries
        may appear in this menu.</p>

src="images/ext_manager.png"><br>
                <b>Figure 5-1</b><br><i>Extension Manager</i></p>
        <p>The extension manager allows you to see a list of installed extensions. You
        can also:
        <ul>
                <li><b>Add an extension</b> - installs an extension into
                Jokosher. This opens up a file selection dialog that allows
                you to chose an <code>.py</code> or <code>.egg</code> file. After
                confirming that you really want to install the extension, you should
                see it in the Installed Extensions list.
                See <a href="#Finding_New_Extensions">Finding New Extensions</a>
                below for more information on getting new extensions.</li>
                <li><b>Remove an extension</b> - removes the currently selected
                extension from your system.</li>
                <li><b>Preferences</b> - allows you to configure the currently
                selected extension. What you can configure here, depends entirely
                on the extension. Please see its documentation for more information.</li>
                <li><b>Close</b> - closes the Extension Manager and brings you back
                to the Jokosher Main Window.</li>
