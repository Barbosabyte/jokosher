aWelcome to Jokosher 0.9!

Jokosher is a simple and easy to use audio multi-tracker
for the Linux desktop. The aim of the project is to 
create a simple yet comprehensive multi-track studio 
that is focussed around the needs of musicians and podcasters.

This is our third release of Jokosher and enables you 
to create music and podcasts. It also includes a range of 
features for recording, playing, editing, mixing, 
post-producing and exporting your compositions.


> Requirements <

* Python 2.4
* GStreamer from CVS
* Python GStreamer from CVS
* Gnonlin (plugin for Gstreamer)
* PyGTK 2.8
* Python Glade2
* Python Cairo
* Python Dbus
* Python XMLPlus
* Python Setuptools 


> Running Jokosher <

Complete instructions for running Jokosher can be found at 
http://www.jokosher.org/download. Due to the reliance on a 
very release of GStreamer that may not yet be distributions, 
we have created a script that automates the process of 
downloading the development snapshot of GStreamer, compiling 
it and running Jokosher.

However, if you already have Gstreamer from CVS installed
just open a terminal and run:

./Jokosher/Jokosher


> Finding Help <

We have a number of resources for help:

 * http://doc.jokosher.org/ - our primary documentation site 
   includes a number of guides and resources that shows you how 
   to drive Jokosher.

 * http://userdocs.jokosher.org/ - a community driven site 
   where HOWTOs and guides are developed to show specific uses 
   of Jokosher in specific situations and contexts.

 * http://www.jokosher.org/forums/ - our popular and bustling 
   community of Jokosher users often congregates on our 
   discussion forums. Here you can ask questions, share your 
   experience and also post links to your compositions and 
   podcasts for other Jokosher users to comment on. This is 
   a great way to get valuable feedback from the community.

Have fun with Jokosher, and do keep in touch!
