Welcome to Jokosher!

Jokosher is a simple and easy to use audio multi-tracker for the Linux desktop. The aim
of this project is create a simple yet comprehensive tool for all your audio needs. This
is the very first release after five months of feverish development. It will therefore
have a few quirks and bugs around.

>-- Requirements --<

For a list of current requirements, see http://www.jokosher.org/download

>-- Installing Jokosher - System wide --<
If your distribution packages Jokosher, it's recommended you use its
respective package manager and install Jokosher with it.

Alternatively, if you're installing from the downloaded Jokosher tarball,
untar it and then, as root, run:
foo@bar:jokosher-X.Y# python setup.py install

>-- Running Jokosher - System wide installation --<

To run it, run:

foo@bar:~$ jokosher

>-- Installing Jokosher - Local installation --<
In case you want to install Jokosher locally, that is, under your home
folder, simply untar the dowloaded tarball into the folder of your choice.

>-- Running Jokosher - Local installation --<
Then be sure to run the file /jokosher-X.Y/Jokosher/Jokosher directly, instead
of the startup script located at the installation root folder.

For example, if you put Jokosher under your home folder:
/home/foo/jokosher

you need to run /home/foo/jokosher/Jokosher/Jokosher and -not-
/home/foo/jokosher/jokosher.
