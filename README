Jokosher

Welcome one and all to Jokosher development!

The aim of this project is to create a simple, and easy to use Open Source multi-track editor. Much of the design has been inspired by
a blog post at http://www.jonobacon.org/viewcomments.php?id=621 - see that for an overview of how the core interface should work. Currently
we are in development mode, so some stuff may work, and some may not.

> Requirements <

Python
GStreamer
librsvg
PyGTK

> Running Jokosher <

To get started, simply make the main Jokosher script executable:

foo@bar:~$ chmod a+x Jokosher.py

Then run it:

foo@bar:~$ ./Jokosher.py

> Getting Involved <

For Jokosher to become what we all want it to become, we need a range of volunteers to help out. This includes developers, testers, artists,
documentation writers and more.

To get involved, see http://jokosher.org/trac and have a look at what you would like to contribute. You should take a
look at http://jokosher.org/trac/report/9 to see which tasks are currently unassigned and looking for volunteers.

You should also join our mailing list at http://jasonfield.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/jonoedit - feel free to ask any
questions there, or send patches in. :)
