#~ "this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n"
#~ "if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n"
#~ "in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n"
#~ "anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n"
#~ "These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n"
#~ "distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n"

#~ "rights.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n"
#~ "(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n"
#~ "distribute and/or modify the software.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n"
#~ "that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n"
#~ "software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n"
#~ "want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n"
#~ "that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n"
#~ "authors' reputations.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n"
#~ "patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\n"
#~ "program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\n"
#~ "program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\n"
#~ "patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n"
#~ "modification follow.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n"
#~ "   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\n"
#~ "a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n"
#~ "under the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\n"
#~ "refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\n"
#~ "means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\n"
#~ "that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\n"
#~ "either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\n"
#~ "language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\n"
#~ "the term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n"
#~ "covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n"
#~ "running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n"
#~ "is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n"
#~ "Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\n"
#~ "Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n"
#~ "source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n"
#~ "conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n"
#~ "copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n"
#~ "notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\n"
#~ "and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\n"
#~ "along with the Program.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n"
#~ "you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n"
#~ "of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n"
#~ "distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n"
#~ "above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n"
#~ "    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n"
#~ "    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n"
#~ "    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n"
#~ "    parties under the terms of this License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n"
#~ "    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n"
#~ "    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n"
#~ "    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n"
#~ "    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n"
#~ "    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n"
#~ "    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n"
#~ "    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n"
#~ "    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n"
#~ "    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n"
#~ "identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\n"
#~ "and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n"
#~ "themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n"
#~ "sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n"
#~ "distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n"
#~ "on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n"
#~ "this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n"
#~ "entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote "
#~ "it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n"
#~ "your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n"
#~ "exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n"
#~ "collective works based on the Program.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n"
#~ "with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\n"
#~ "a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n"
#~ "the scope of this License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n"
#~ "under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n"
#~ "Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n"
#~ "    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n"
#~ "    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; "
#~ "or,\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n"
#~ "    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n"
#~ "    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n"
#~ "    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n"
#~ "    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n"
#~ "    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n"
#~ "    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n"
#~ "    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n"
#~ "    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n"
#~ "    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n"
#~ "making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\n"
#~ "code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n"
#~ "associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\n"
#~ "control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\n"
#~ "special exception, the source code distributed need not include\n"
#~ "anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\n"
#~ "form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n"
#~ "operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n"
#~ "itself accompanies the executable.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n"
#~ "access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\n"
#~ "access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\n"
#~ "distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\n"
#~ "compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n"
#~ "except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n"
#~ "otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\n"
#~ "void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n"
#~ "However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\n"
#~ "this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\n"
#~ "parties remain in full compliance.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n"
#~ "signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n"
#~ "distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\n"
#~ "prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n"
#~ "modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n"
#~ "Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n"
#~ "all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n"
#~ "the Program or works based on it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n"
#~ "Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n"
#~ "original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n"
#~ "these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n"
#~ "restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n"
#~ "You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n"
#~ "this License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n"
#~ "infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n"
#~ "conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n"
#~ "otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n"
#~ "excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n"
#~ "distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n"
#~ "License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n"
#~ "may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\n"
#~ "license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\n"
#~ "all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n"
#~ "the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n"
#~ "refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n"
#~ "any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n"
#~ "apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n"
#~ "circumstances.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n"
#~ "patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n"
#~ "such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n"
#~ "integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\n"
#~ "implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n"
#~ "generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n"
#~ "through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n"
#~ "system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n"
#~ "to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n"
#~ "impose that choice.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n"
#~ "be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\n"
#~ "certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n"
#~ "original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\n"
#~ "may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\n"
#~ "those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\n"
#~ "countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\n"
#~ "the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new "
#~ "versions\n"
#~ "of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n"
#~ "be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n"
#~ "address new problems or concerns.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n"
#~ "specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n"
#~ "later version\", you have the option of following the terms and "
#~ "conditions\n"
#~ "either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\n"
#~ "Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number "
#~ "of\n"
#~ "this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free "
#~ "Software\n"
#~ "Foundation.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n"
#~ "programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the "
#~ "author\n"
#~ "to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\n"
#~ "Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n"
#~ "make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\n"
#~ "of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software "
#~ "and\n"
#~ "of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO "
#~ "WARRANTY\n"
#~ "FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\n"
#~ "OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\n"
#~ "PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER "
#~ "EXPRESSED\n"
#~ "OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n"
#~ "MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK "
#~ "AS\n"
#~ "TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\n"
#~ "PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\n"
#~ "REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN "
#~ "WRITING\n"
#~ "WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\n"
#~ "REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR "
#~ "DAMAGES,\n"
#~ "INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES "
#~ "ARISING\n"
#~ "OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT "
#~ "LIMITED\n"
#~ "TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\n"
#~ "YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY "
#~ "OTHER\n"

#~ "the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\n"
#~ "your programs, too.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n"
#~ "price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n"
#~ "have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n"
#~ "this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n"
#~ "if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n"
#~ "in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n"
#~ "anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n"
#~ "These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n"
#~ "distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n"
#~ "gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\n"
#~ "you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n"
#~ "source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\n"
#~ "rights.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n"
#~ "(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n"
#~ "distribute and/or modify the software.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n"
#~ "that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n"
#~ "software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n"
#~ "want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n"
#~ "that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n"
#~ "authors' reputations.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n"
#~ "patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\n"
#~ "program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\n"
#~ "program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\n"
#~ "patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n"
#~ "modification follow.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n"
#~ "   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\n"
#~ "a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n"
#~ "under the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\n"
#~ "refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\n"
#~ "means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\n"
#~ "that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\n"
#~ "either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\n"
#~ "language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\n"
#~ "the term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n"
#~ "covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n"
#~ "running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n"
#~ "is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n"
#~ "Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\n"
#~ "Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n"
#~ "source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n"
#~ "conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n"
#~ "copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n"
#~ "notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\n"
#~ "and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\n"
#~ "along with the Program.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n"
#~ "you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n"
#~ "of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n"
#~ "distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n"
#~ "above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n"
#~ "    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n"
#~ "    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n"
#~ "    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n"
#~ "    parties under the terms of this License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n"
#~ "    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n"
#~ "    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n"
#~ "    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n"
#~ "    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n"
#~ "    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n"
#~ "    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n"
#~ "    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n"
#~ "    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n"
#~ "    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n"
#~ "identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\n"
#~ "and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n"
#~ "themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n"
#~ "sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n"
#~ "distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n"
#~ "on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n"
#~ "this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n"
#~ "entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote "
#~ "it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n"
#~ "your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n"
#~ "exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n"
#~ "collective works based on the Program.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n"
#~ "with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\n"
#~ "a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n"
#~ "the scope of this License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n"
#~ "under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n"
#~ "Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n"
#~ "    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n"
#~ "    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; "
#~ "or,\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n"
#~ "    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n"
#~ "    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n"
#~ "    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n"
#~ "    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n"
#~ "    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n"
#~ "    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n"
#~ "    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n"
#~ "    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n"
#~ "    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n"
#~ "making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\n"
#~ "code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n"
#~ "associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\n"
#~ "control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\n"
#~ "special exception, the source code distributed need not include\n"
#~ "anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\n"
#~ "form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n"
#~ "operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n"
#~ "itself accompanies the executable.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n"
#~ "access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\n"
#~ "access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\n"
#~ "distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\n"
#~ "compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n"
#~ "except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n"
#~ "otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\n"
#~ "void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n"
#~ "However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\n"
#~ "this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\n"
#~ "parties remain in full compliance.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n"
#~ "signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n"
#~ "distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\n"
#~ "prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n"
#~ "modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n"
#~ "Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n"
#~ "all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n"
#~ "the Program or works based on it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n"
#~ "Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n"
#~ "original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n"
#~ "these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n"
#~ "restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n"
#~ "You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n"
#~ "this License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n"
#~ "infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n"
#~ "conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n"
#~ "otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n"
#~ "excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n"
#~ "distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n"
#~ "License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n"
#~ "may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\n"
#~ "license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\n"
#~ "all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n"
#~ "the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n"
#~ "refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n"
#~ "any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n"
#~ "apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n"
#~ "circumstances.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n"
#~ "patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n"
#~ "such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n"
#~ "integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\n"
#~ "implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n"
#~ "generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n"
#~ "through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n"
#~ "system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n"
#~ "to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n"
#~ "impose that choice.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n"
#~ "be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\n"
#~ "certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n"
#~ "original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\n"
#~ "may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\n"
#~ "those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\n"
#~ "countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\n"
#~ "the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new "
#~ "versions\n"
#~ "of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n"
#~ "be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n"
#~ "address new problems or concerns.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n"
#~ "specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n"
#~ "later version\", you have the option of following the terms and "
#~ "conditions\n"
#~ "either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\n"
#~ "Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number "
#~ "of\n"
#~ "this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free "
#~ "Software\n"
#~ "Foundation.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n"
#~ "programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the "
#~ "author\n"
#~ "to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\n"
#~ "Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n"
#~ "make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\n"
#~ "of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software "
#~ "and\n"
#~ "of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO "
#~ "WARRANTY\n"
#~ "FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\n"
#~ "OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\n"
#~ "PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER "
#~ "EXPRESSED\n"
#~ "OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n"
#~ "MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK "
#~ "AS\n"
#~ "TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\n"
#~ "PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\n"
#~ "REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN "
#~ "WRITING\n"
#~ "WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\n"
#~ "REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR "
#~ "DAMAGES,\n"
#~ "INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES "
#~ "ARISING\n"
#~ "OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT "
#~ "LIMITED\n"
#~ "TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\n"
#~ "YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY "
#~ "OTHER\n"
#~ "PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\n"
#~ "POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n"

#~ "\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n"
